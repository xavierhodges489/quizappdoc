            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Story Boarding</h3>
                    <p>Creating the initial storyboard, we knew we wanted to have a series of quizzes made from other users and the ability to create quizzes easily. The storyboard was just a very broad example of why some students would have a reason as to why they would use our quiz app. For example, a quiz / exam would be coming up and rather than creating flash cards or just rewriting notes they would create quizzes or take quizzes from other students of the subject / class they need to study.</p>

                    <h3>2. Prototyping</h3>
                    <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
                    <p>To get a better understanding of the different elements we needed for the web application, we sought out to design a cheap and easy prototype. This led us to designing a paper prototype. The prototype gave us some good insights into how the user would be using our website. If a new user was coming to our page to take a specific quiz that they heard about from another student or professor we would need a way for them to easily locate that quiz. This led to the addition of a search function that would allow the user to filter through all the quizzes to find a specific one. Our paper prototype also led us to realize that the user would enjoy using our application better if they could see their progress on quizzes over time. To implement this we sought out to add a results page to our web application that would allow the user to see how they have improved on quizzes they have taken multiple times.</p>

                    <h4>Digital Prototype</h4>
                    <p>The digital prototype was created using the paper prototype as the backbone. The digital prototype was a means to truly visualize what we wanted users to see upon using our application. When first opening the application users will be greeted by the login screen, where after entering their username and password are taken to the home page. The home page then displays information specific to the person that has logged in. The home page displays the quizzes that the user has taken recently, their top subject, and will suggest quizzes to them. We wanted to show users where they excel and areas where they could use work; and also suggest to them quizzes that could help them improve. We decided that the homepage would be the most efficient place to display their stats.</p>

                    <h3>3. Functional Prototype</h3>
                    <p>When setting out to design a user interface we wanted to keep usability and simplicity in mind. This led us to use some of the most cutting edge javascript libraries available. The two libraries that work as stepping stones for our web application are React and materialUI. Read more about them below.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>React</h3>
                    <p>React is used to add a dynamic element to our application. It allows us to write custom HTML elements and switch between them at will. This keeps the actual HTML writing to a minimum and focuses more on writing reusable components that function as the application. We have our web application broken down into six main components. These components are login, signup, home, createQuiz, takeQuiz, and myQuizzes. These components alone are not enough to make a web page, which is where materialUI comes in.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Material UI</h3>
                    <p>MaterialUI is similar to Bootstrap where it has custom HTML elements that already have CSS added to them. The main stand out one for our application is Card. The Card element is what we use to break up our web page into different sections. It allows your eyes to easily focus on what's important on the page and keeps you from having large chunks of text that have no discernible beginning or end. The card functions like a HTML div element, but also adds a white background behind anything within the Card element. This allows it to stand apart from other elements on the webpage.</p>

                    <h3>Firebase</h3>
                    <p>Our application needed a backend that was quick and responsive. To fill this need we used Googleâ€™s Firebase. This service allowed us to have a server to host a Document-oriented database on, run nodeJS functions on inorder to manipulate the database, and host our web application. This all in one service allows our application to be quick and efficient.</p>
